# Deckiest_Deck_of_Cards# The Deckiest Deck of Cards

## Description 

The Deckiest Deck of Cards is an app that will create a deck of cards. The will have 52 cards with traditional casino-styled suits. Aces are low in this deck. There is the ability to shuffle the deck and draw cards.

This app was created using Test Driven Development, or simply, TDD. Uses the Ruby language and the test library RSpec. The tests used in creating this app are also included. There were sets of tests for the creation of cards and sets of tests for the creation of the deck.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use several Ruby methods, such as .include? and to_s, to show some level of proficiency. 

## Project status

I'm interested in further developing this app into a Black Jack game, complete with a betting system and side bets. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out.
