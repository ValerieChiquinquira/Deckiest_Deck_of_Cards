# The Deckiest Deck of Cards

## Description 

The Deckiest Deck of Cards is an app that will create a deck of cards. The will have 52 cards with traditional casino-styled suits. Aces are low in this deck. There is the ability to shuffle the deck and draw cards.

This app was created using Test Driven Development, or simply, TDD. Uses the Ruby language and the test library rspec. 


## Installation

To clone this locally and run the rspec tests:

- ensure you have ruby on your machine
- <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/>

- To clone github repo
```bash 

git clone  <repo.url >

cd deckydecky

ruby decky.rb 
```

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use several Ruby methods, such as .include? and to_s, to show some level of proficiency. 

## Project status

I'm interested in further developing this app into a Black Jack game, complete with a betting system and side bets. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out.
